Inventory Management System - Backend
This is the backend for the Inventory Management System, built with Spring Boot. It provides a RESTful API for managing inventory items, including functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items. The backend connects to a PostgreSQL database and includes validation, pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities.

Project Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Code kopieren
git clone <repository-url>
Database Setup
Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a database called inventorydb.

Configuration
Update the application.properties file with your PostgreSQL credentials:

properties
Code kopieren
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/inventorydb
spring.datasource.username=YOUR_USERNAME
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_PASSWORD
Run the Application
Use the following command to start the Spring Boot application:

bash
Code kopieren
mvn spring-boot:run
Access the API
Once the application is running, you can access the API at http://localhost:8080/api/inventory.

API Structure
Endpoints
GET /api/inventory
Retrieves a paginated list of inventory items, with optional query parameters for sorting, searching by name or sku, and filtering by category.

POST /api/inventory
Adds a new item to the inventory. Requires all fields to be valid.

GET /api/inventory/{id}
Retrieves an item by its ID.

PUT /api/inventory/{id}
Updates an existing itemâ€™s details by ID.

DELETE /api/inventory/{id}
Deletes an item by ID.

Query Parameters for Sorting, Filtering, and Pagination
Sorting
You can sort by name, quantity, or price by adding sort=name or similar in the query.

Filtering
Use name, sku, and category as query parameters to filter the results.

Pagination
Use page and size query parameters to paginate results (default is page=0 and size=10).

Example Requests
Retrieve all items, sorted by name:

http
Code kopieren
GET /api/inventory?sort=name
Retrieve items with name containing "Laptop" and category "Electronics":

http
Code kopieren
GET /api/inventory?name=Laptop&category=Electronics
Add a new item:

http
Code kopieren
POST /api/inventory
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Wireless Keyboard",
  "sku": "KEY123",
  "quantity": 50,
  "price": 29.99,
  "category": "Accessories"
}
Error Handling
The backend includes custom exception handling for various cases:

Item Not Found
Returns 404 Not Found if an item with a specified ID does not exist.

Validation Errors
Returns 400 Bad Request if there are validation issues with the data (e.g., missing required fields).

Database Errors
Handles common database-related errors gracefully.

Testing
The backend includes both unit and integration tests:

Unit Tests
Cover the service layer to ensure business logic and validation are working as expected.

Integration Tests
Cover the controller layer to test the API endpoints.

To run the tests, use the following command:

bash
Code kopieren
mvn test
